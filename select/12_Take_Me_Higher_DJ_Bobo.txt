Let's turn it up and feel the music
Just be yourself and lose control
Come make it loud and get addicted
To the sound you can't let go (to the sound you can't let go)
You send the spark, I start the fire
And let it burn all through the night
(Let it burn, burn through the night)
The fever's rising to the limit
'Till the early morning light

Everybody
Keep dancing, keep on dancing
Come take me higher, relight my fire
Keep dancing, keep on dancing
Come take me higher
You can make me fly
Keep dancing, keep on dancing
Come take me higher, relight my fire
Keep dancing, keep on dancing
Come take me higher
You can make me fly

(Full of fire)
(Full of light)
(Full of fire)
(You can make me fly)

We break the rules, we hit the dance floor
And move our bodies to the beat (to the beat)
Intoxicated by the kick drum
We are rising up the heat
We're in the zone, and full of rhythm
(Rhythm is comin' to get ya')
The bass is pumpin' in our veins
(Pumpin' in our veins)
It's just too good, don't stop the feeling
(Don't stop the feeling)
'Cause tonight the music rains

Everybody
Keep dancing, keep on dancing
Come take me higher, relight my fire
Keep dancing, keep on dancing
Come take me higher
You can make me fly
Keep dancing, keep on dancing
Come take me higher, relight my fire
Keep dancing, keep on dancing
Come take me higher
You can make me fly

(Full of fire)
(Full of light)
(Full of fire)
(You can make me fly)

Keep dancing, keep on dancing
